**Proposal for Node.js API Solution and Deployment**

---

**Dear Client,**

I am pleased to present my proposal to assist you in solving and deploying your Node.js APIs integrated with your mobile application. Below is the step-by-step work plan to complete this task.

### Objective
Resolve the non-functional APIs of your application and deploy the fixes on Heroku.

### Work Plan

#### Phase 1: Project Preparation and Understanding

1. **Review of Current Code**:
   - Clone the project repository to my local machine.
   - Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Configure and run the project locally to understand its current functionality and reproduce the errors.

2. **Problem Identification**:
   - Review the provided documentation and specifications to identify the non-functional APIs.
   - Analyze the logs and error messages to understand the nature of the problems.

3. **Understanding the Production Environment**:
   - Familiarize myself with the Heroku configuration and environment variables used in the project.
   - Verify the configuration of the database and other integrated services.

#### Phase 2: Diagnosis and Error Correction

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Analyze the code of each problematic API to identify the root cause of the issues.
   - Verify the routes, controllers, and middleware associated with the APIs.

5. **Error Correction**:
   - Implement the necessary fixes in the code.
   - Ensure that the fixes do not affect other functionalities of the project.
   - Perform unit and integration tests to validate that the APIs work correctly.

#### Phase 3: Thorough Testing

6. **Local Testing**:
   - Test the corrected APIs in the local environment using tools like Postman or Insomnia.
   - Verify that all specified functionalities are operational and that the errors have been resolved.

7. **Automated Testing**:
   - Create or update automated tests to ensure code stability.
   - Run all automated tests to ensure no new errors have been introduced.

#### Phase 4: Deployment on Heroku

8. **Deployment Preparation**:
   - Update the `Procfile` and necessary configurations for deployment on Heroku.
   - Verify that all environment variables are correctly configured in the Heroku panel.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Commit the changes and push to the Heroku repository (`git push heroku master`).
   - Verify the deployment in the Heroku dashboard and ensure the application has been deployed correctly.

10. **Production Testing**:
    - Test the APIs in the production environment to ensure their correct functioning.
    - Perform load tests if necessary to guarantee scalability and performance.

#### Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

11. **Monitoring**:
    - Set up monitoring tools to supervise performance and errors in production.
    - Periodically review logs and metrics to detect and resolve any new issues.

12. **Documentation and Delivery**:
    - Document the fixes made and the changes implemented.
    - Deliver a detailed report of the work done and the tests conducted.

13. **Time Tracker Configuration**:
    - Install the time tracking software as per the provided instructions.
    - Ensure the tracker is working correctly before starting the work.

### Tools and Resources Needed
- **Development Tools**: Node.js, npm, Postman, Insomnia, Git.
- **Deployment Platform**: Heroku.
- **Time Tracking Software**: As per provided instructions.

### Estimated Time
- Review and Preparation: 4-6 hours
- Diagnosis and Correction: 8-12 hours
- Testing: 4-6 hours
- Deployment and Verification: 2-4 hours
- Monitoring and Maintenance: 2-4 hours

### Communication
- I will maintain constant communication to report progress and any blockers encountered.
- I will conduct periodic meetings (daily or as required) to review the status of the work.

I hope this proposal meets your expectations and I am available for any additional queries.

Thank you for the opportunity to collaborate with you on this project.

Sincerely,

Oscar M Alvarez GÃ³mez
